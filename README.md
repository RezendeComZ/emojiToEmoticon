# emojiToEmoticon

A useless project to convert emoji to MSN emoticons.
The only valid use is for [MSN Escargot servers](https://escargot.log1p.xyz) (yeah, they're still running).

Try it [here](https://rezendecomz.github.io/emojiToEmoticon/)

The [grapheme-splitter](https://github.com/orling/grapheme-splitter) is slightly modified.
